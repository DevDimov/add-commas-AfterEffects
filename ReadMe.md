# Add automatic commas to counting numbers in Adobe After Effects

1. In After Effects, create a text layer and add the "Slider Control" effect to it.
2. Alt-click on the "Source Text" property of the text layer and paste the code from addCommas.js

# Note to programmers

I'm aware that the same result can be achieved with a complex regular expression and only a few lines of code. On this occasion, however, I decided to come up with an alternative solution that is easier to read.

# Java Version

See addCommas.java
